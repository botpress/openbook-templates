# Technical Information

This is about the technical information regarding Cryptos

## Mining Algorithm

This is about the mining algorithm implemented in mining Cryptos

- Xhash is a proof-of-work algorithm initially used as the first mining algorithm of Cryptos 1.0 and became one of the basis for future mining algorithms.
- Cryptos uses the K algorithm, a protocol based on the P and Ehash algorithms, whose primary goal is to eliminate the issues of mining centralisation by taking advantage of the GPU memory and computing capabilities.
- Cryptos is mined strictly by a Proof Of Work algorithm based on a variant of the CryptoNight algorithm and utilized for efficient mining with modern 32bit CPUs and GPUs.

## Cryptocurrency Characteristics

This is about the distinct features of Cryptos

- Based on its excellent liquidity track record, X tokens are considered as the easiest to trade token based on its daily records.
- Cryptos is a community driven, open-source cryptocurrency that is ASIC resistant and no extra coins are held for rewarding the founders and developers.
- Cryptos is one of the cryptocurrencies that places value in completely private, unmonitored and free from censorship transactions.

## Native Cryptocurrency

This is about the native cryptocurrency of each platform

- The native cryptocurrency of Cryptos is ecoin (EC) which users can use to pay other users so that their code requests are fulfilled.
- Bcoins is the native cryptocurrency of the Bcrypto blockchain.
- The native cryptocurrency of Cryptos, RCoin, functions as the gas or fuel of the platform by facilitating transaction costs and paying network validators for the security and verification of the cryptocurrency transactions.

## Supported Blockchains

This is about the supported blockchains of Cryptos

- TCoins are integrated and adopted for various blockchain networks such as public blockchains, private blockchains, consortium blockchains and hybrid blockchains.
- As a fork of BCrypto, RCoin’s coding framework supports smart-contract blockchains such as Solana, Stellar and many others.
- The blockchain implemented by MCoin is opaque, wherein all the details of transactions such as the amount exchanged are all hidden and made anonymous.

## Supported Wallets

This is about the wallets that support the transactions of Cryptos

- Cryptos suggests that cryptocurrency beginners can use newbie friendly wallets such as Zengo, Electrum, Binance and Exodus.
- According to the BCoin community, the best wallet for beginners in BCoin is Coinbase Wallet while the best mobile wallet is Mycelium.
- The MCoin community has developed an open-sourced free to use GUI Wallet called M GUI Wallet that is ideal for beginners and advanced users.

This is about the Cryptos’ supported currencies

- TCrypto supports the US Dollar (USD), Chinese yuan (CNH) and Euro (EUR).
- The current USD equivalent price of Cryptos is $2600.00.
- Kraken is one of the centralized exchanges that supports the trading of MCrypto to national currencies such as EUR, USD and GBP.

## Block time

This is about the average block time of Cryptos

- Block time refers to the duration of time it takes to mine a block and it can be categorized to expected block time and average block time.
- The average block time and expected block time of a cryptocurrency are used to compute its mining difficulty.
- The average block time of Cryptos is between 12 to 14 seconds which may vary depending on the network hash rate and hash complexity.

## Mining Pools

This is about the mining pools that support Cryptos mining

- Some of the mining pools that support RCrypto are 2MinB and LB.
- Emine is the Cryptos mining pool with the highest joint hash power compared to all mining nodes.
- One of the most popular and easiest to use MCrypto mining pools is Mgate.
