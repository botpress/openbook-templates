# Hospital Affiliation and Referrals

Affiliated Hospitals

## Referrals Procedure

This is information about the referral procedure to hospitals

- Patients needing emergency care can be transferred to the nearest clinic center with transport provided by M Doctors.
- When an emergency situation occurs, the patient is first assisted in the office, provided with initial care or first aid, while the M Doctors secretary reaches the partner hospitals for coordination.
- If a hospital ambulance is not available to pick up the patient, M Doctors' mini-ambulance may be used.
- Referral documents including initial patient assessment will be brought with the patient to the hospital.
- M Doctors don’t hold medical information for patients hospitalized in partner hospitals and therefore can’t provide information to the patient's family.
