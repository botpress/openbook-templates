# Products

This is about the kinds of products Turbine X has.

## Offshore

This is about Turbine X's offshore type wind turbines.

- Turbine X's offshore wind turbines are those that are located off the shore and basically are on the sea or water.
- Turbine X's offshore wind turbines are ideal for high wind conditions.
- Turbine X has a direct drive turbine type of windmills for offshore turbines.
- Turbine X's direct drive turbine uses fewer moving parts than comparable geared machines.
- Turbine X originally has three direct drive turbines namely; SWT-6.5-155, SWT-7.5-155, and SG 8.5-167 DD.
- Turbine X has recently added three offshore turbines namely; SG 14-237 DD, SG 14-222 DD, and SG 11.0- 200 DD.
- Turbine X uses a larger rotor to lower the risks and increase energy production.
- Turbine X's offshore turbines are recommended for both high and low wind markets.

## Onshore

This is about Turbine X's onshore type wind turbines.

- Turbine X's onshore wind turbines are those that are located on the shore.
- Turbine X's onshore wind turbines are ideal for low and medium wind conditions.
- Turbine X has three kinds of onshore turbines namely; turbine 3.X, turbine 4.X, and turbine 5.X.
- Turbine X's 3.X is an optimized design for low and medium wind conditions.
- Turbine X's 3.X is a benchmark solution with high capacity factors.
- Turbine X's 3.X guarantees high-energy production and low noise emissions.
- Turbine X's 4.X is ideal for low wind conditions.
- Turbine X's 4.X guarantees increased production and lower LCoE.
- Turbine X's 5.X offers you an outstanding value proposition.
- Turbine X's 5.X ideal for low and medium wind conditions.
- Turbine X's 5.X incorporates proven technologies, minimizing risks, and guaranteeing reliability.
