# User Protection and Security

This is about the different user protection and security implemented by the crypto wallet company.

## User Protection

This is about the user protection programmes implemented by the crypto wallet company

- CryptoWallet stores a percentage of all trading fees in a secure asset fund so that the wallet will be able to protect a share of user funds.
- Advanced access control allows users to restrict devices and addresses that can access the account.
- CryptoWallet advises users to protect their 12-word secret recovery phrase because it is the master key to the wallets.

## Data Encryption

This is about the data encryption protocols implemented by the crypto wallet company

- CryptoWallet assures that all transaction data is secured via end-to-end encryption, ensuring that only the user has access to his/her personal information.
- Every specific asset within the CryptoWallet has its own private key but there are some assets that require multiple private keys for each specific address.
- CryptoWallet has a strategic partnership with Cryptos, integrating its institutional-grade custody solution, CryptoWalletSolution and leveraging hardware security modules (HSM) and multi-signature technologies.
